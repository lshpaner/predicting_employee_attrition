# Predicting Employee Attrition – A Human Resources Use-Case

### Purpose:
We have endeavored to build a sustainable system-wide business-model while leveraging predictive analytics to solve a universal human resources problem – employee attrition and retention. The overarching goal is adoption by any given human resource department – identifying, pre-emptively targeting pitfalls/ gaps in employee trajectories, and ultimately reducing attrition.

### Background:
An undisclosed multinational corporation (MNC) has provided an Excel (.xlsx) file for academic research in people analytics. However, the use-case can and extend to practical human resources problem-solving methods.

### Current Situation:
People analytics has traditionally benefited from “using statistical insights from employee data to make talent management decisions” (Leonardi & Contractor, 2018). While gathering historical information on employees’ performance, promotional patterns, and length of time served are valuable tools, they do not extend to establishing trajectories that can be useful in a decision-making framework. Data in and of itself is not inherently valuable unless it yields high quality information that, in turn, yields actionable insights. For example, “Tata Consultancy Services found that just 5% of big-data investments go to HR, the group that typically manages people analytics… only 9% of companies believe they have a good understanding of which talent dimensions drive performance in their organizations” (Leonardi & Contractor, 2018). Investing money into something that is not used or useful further drains the company’s bottom line.

### Conclusion:
Understanding what drives employee attrition need not be relegated to the structure and confines of a psychological research study. Understanding performance trends visa vie predictive, and more importantly, prescriptive analytics will give credence to people analytics being a worthwhile investment for any company to follow.
